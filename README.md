# StoryHard

Minecraft but a bit hardcore! The goal of the plugin is to make your survival as complicated as possible but if you die
you don't lose your progress. This is not the real hardcore of Minecraft.

## Installing
Installing Vault is as simple as copying the provided "StoryHard.jar" to your
"<bukkit-install-dir>/plugins" directory and the rest is automatic!  If you
wish to perform configuration changes, this can be done via a configuration
file but should not be necessary in most cases.  See the "Advanced
Configuration" section for more information.
